The team usually participate with, always had a lot of fun by doing them.

I come from a French-speaking community as a technical security consultant, I'm Haitian. I make content about security and hacking on my blog (Hackbookin), and I used to share my knowledge like a content creator on YouTube (Terlinux), and I have a french community talking about hacking and security, it's like 1.5k people on telegram messenger, I wrote an ebook in french about termux, an android emulator, it was really appreciated by my community, about 20k read, I published it in 2019 when I was in high school (bachelor), . ... in short, my experience in this field is quite medium, but I still learn every day on Tryhackme, a web platform to learn about cybersecurity, my profile name is zorkalel, and I have some certifications in information security and hacking, by the way, I'm just starting a university career in computer science. I'm a programmer in Python and PHP, I wrote some basic program in Python like port scanning and so on ... in PHP I worked on a web vulnerability project called SWAV, my personal project.

        <h3>4. SpyPro - The Automate</h3>
        <p>SpyPro automates the pentesting process from reconnaissance to target exploitation. It is specifically designed for CTF challenges and has an educational purpose. Currently, it supports Linux boxes, and I recommend keeping a manual note-taking process to produce your final report. I follow the PTES methodology. The tool is in English, and it utilizes the Kali Linux database to load most of the tools.</p>
